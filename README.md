# AI Sketchbook 

This project demonstrates how to use Stable Diffusion (version 1.5) with Hugging Face Diffusers to generate images from text prompts. The model is integrated with Gradio, a simple and interactive web-based UI framework, allowing users to experiment with AI-generated images directly in their browser.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- **Text-to-Image** – Enter a prompt and generate AI-created images in seconds.
- **Customizable Parameters** – Adjust guidance scale and steps for fine-tuned results.
- **One-Click Download** – Save generated images directly to your device.
- **Simple Setup** – Built with Python and Hugging Face’s Diffusers library.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Deep Learning & Diffusion**: `torch`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`, `diffusers`, `transformers`, `accelerate`  
- **Interface & Deployment**: `gradio`  
- **Utils**: `datetime`  
- **Hugging Face Hub Integration**: `huggingface_hub`
